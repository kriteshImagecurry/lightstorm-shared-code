          Polarin Port Service Schedule <br />
          Polarin Port is a high-speed Ethernet interface that provides a
          gateway that customers need to access Polarin’s other services such as
          data centre interconnect, cloud connectivity, IX and CDN connectivity.{" "}
          <br />
          Provisioning a port is the first step in accessing most Polarin
          services. The only exception is the Polarin Virtual Router, which does
          not require a port. Port Capacities offered: 1G, 10G and 100G. You
          first provision a port and then set up a cross connection from that
          port to your on-premises equipment. Once that is complete, all other
          services can be provisioned and de-provisioned virtually. Cross
          Connects can be arranged by Polarin team upon customer’s request
          however, the ordered cross connects are not covered under Polarin SLA.
          The service is available at selected data centers. <br />
          Service Levels <br />
          The Service Availability for Port is defined as the Port’s monthly

          Level target for Port Service Availability is 100%. <br />
          Service Availability is defined as the monthly average availability of
          ports (regardless of network segments), expressed as percentage. The
          calculation excludes: <br />• local loop or last mile via third-party
          suppliers. <br />• connectivity between Lightstorm node to CSP edge
          device. <br />
          Service Availability = (((Charging Period) – (Excused Downtime)) /
          (Charging Period)) * 100%. <br />
          Charging Period means the charging period applicable to Customer’s
