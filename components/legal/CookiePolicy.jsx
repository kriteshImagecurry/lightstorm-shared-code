        <h3>Information about our use of Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Lightstorm Telecom Connectivity Private Limited (hereinafter referred
          to as the "Company") owns an online platform i.e.,
          www.lightstormtelecom.com and/or mobile app namely lightstorm
          (hereinafter referred to as the "Website"). The Companyis committed to
          respect your (“you” or “user”) online privacy. This Cookie Policy
          explains how and why cookies and other similar technologies may be
          stored on and accessed from your device when you use or visit our
          Website.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Company uses cookies and other similar technologies to distinguish
          you from other users who visit our Website. This can help us provide
          better experience for you when you browse our Website and allow us to
          improve our Website.

        <h3>What are Cookies?</h3>
        <p>
          Cookie is a small text file containingsmall amounts of information
          which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you visit
          a website. Upon your consent, we store cookies in the memory or disk
          of your computer or portable device and use them as the tags to
          recognize your computer or portable device.
          <br />
          <br />
          Both websites and HTML emails may also contain other tracking
          technologies such as “web beacons” or “pixels.” These are typically
          small transparent images that provide us with statistics, for similar
          purposes as cookies. They are often used in conjunction with cookies,
          though they are not stored on your computer in the same way. As a
          result, if you disable cookies, web beacons may still load, but their
          functionality will be restricted.
        </p>
      </div>

        <h3>Classification of Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are usually classNameified into ‘Session cookie’ or
          ‘Persistent cookie’ or ‘First Party cookie’ or ‘Third Party cookie’.
          <br />
          <br />
          ‘Session cookies’ can help you effectively browse our Website, track
          your page browsing progress, so you are not asked to provide repeated
          information during your visit. Session cookies are stored in the
          temporary memory and deleted when the Web browser is closed.
          <br />
          <br />
          ‘Persistent cookies’ can keep user preferences so that your
          preferences are still valid when you restart the browser. For example,
          we use persistent Cookies to record the language, country/region, font
          size, or other settings that you selected. When you visit our Website
          the next time, you do not need to set again.
          <br />
          <br />
          ‘First-Party cookies’ are set by the website visited by the user. The
          data collected using first-party cookies is used for purposes like
          calculating pageviews, sessions, and number of users.
          <br />
          <br />
          ‘Third-Party cookies’ are set by domains that are not directly visited
          by the user. This happens when publishers add third-party elements
          (like chatbot, social plugins, or ads) on their website.

        <h3>How we use Cookies?</h3>
        <p>
          You can manage cookies through the browser or delete cookies stored on
          your device. Most browsers can block cookies.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Company will not use cookies for any purposes other than those
          specified in this Cookie Policy. You can manage or delete cookies as
          you like. You can clear all cookies stored on your computer, and most
          web browsers provide the cookie blocking function. If you do it,
          however, you need to change settings every time you visit our Website.
          To learn more about how to change browser settings, please contact the
          developer of the browser you use or find relevant information on the
          Internet.
          <br />
          <br />
          Apart from cookies, we also use similar technologies such as Web
          beacons and pixel tags on our Website. For example, we send your
          account activation link to your mailbox. The above-mentioned
          technologies can help us learn about your preferences on our products
          and service and improve our customer service. The Web beacon is a
          transparent image embedded in a website or email. The pixel tag in an
          email can let us know whether the email is opened. If you do not want
          your activities to be tracked in this way, you can set your mailbox to
          not receiving our email service or log in to our relevant service site
          to unsubscribe from the email service.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you enable the Do Not Track function of your browser, our service
          Website will respect your choice.
